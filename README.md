# Hangman
Words aren't scary are they?

## About
This repository contains code for a full hangman game based off of one of the problem sets from the MIT6.0001 "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" course. For convenience, I included the problem set instructions as a pdf file in this repository. 

## Before Playing...
To run my code, some version of python3 should be installed. I also recommend any code editor (e.g. visual studio code) to take a gander at the code I wrote. Afterwards, download the repository contents on your local machine. 

Once you have done that, you should see four files. Open up the hangman.py in your text editor.
