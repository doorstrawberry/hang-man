# Hangman
Words aren't scary are they?

## About
This repository contains code for a full hangman game based off of one of the problem sets from the MIT6.0001 "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" course. For convenience, I included the problem set instructions as a pdf file in this repository. 

## Before Playing...
To run my code, some version of python3 and numpy should be installed. I also recommend any code editor (e.g. visual studio code) to take a gander at the code I wrote. Afterwards, download the repository contents on your local machine. You should rename the folder to "hangman" if it is not already named that way.

Once you have done that, open the repository in your code editor. You should see four files. Open up the hangman.py file. Here are some changes you may need to make.

On line 19, I refer to a file with a list of words used in the game. 
```python3
WORDLIST_FILENAME = "words.txt"
```
Ensure that the code is properly linked to words.txt by executing hangman.py. If you do not receive a "FileNotFound" error, you are all set to play!
